### generativeText

I' m going to be working during the next weeks to change this completely. The changes I'm working on are:

* Take out the jQuery Dependency. Make it to a pure Javascript Library.
* Move the whole thing to create objects, rather than using a monolithic library.
* Clean the whole thing up.
* Write a complete test suit.
* Add all CSS properties that are currently being used (text shadows, transform, etc)
* Write propper documentation, some examples and a proper GUI to test it.
