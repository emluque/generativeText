### generativeText

An experimental (currently it's a work in progress) javascript generative design library for CSS text transformations. See the examples to understand what I mean.

I'm currently working on this. I'm using github as a versioning system. Once I have reached an acceptable level of completion I will update this file with some documentation and a proper explanation of what this library does and it's intentions.

## Dependencies

I have developed this on top of: jQuery 1.10.2 . Have no idea if it works with earlier versions.
