### generativeText

I' m going to be working during the next weeks to change this completely. Among the changes we'll see soon are:

. Take out the jQuery Dependencies. Make it to a pure Javascript Library.
. Move the whole thing to create objects, rather than using a monolithic library. This should help to add a proper resizing function.
. Clean the whole thing up.
. Write a complete test suit.
. Add all CSS properties that are currently being used (text shadows, transform, etc)
. Write propper documentation, some examples and a proper GUI to test it.
